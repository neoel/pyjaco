Lots of things to do, although most things even pretty unclear to me as well. 
Therefore I create this file, describing most things as clear as possible. 

Todo:

Transformers
  - functions:
        Make sure the functions are transformed correctly to pythonic functions. this means default arguments, keywords arguments, args and kwargs are supported.
  - namespacing:
        Make sure every variable comes from a known source. otherwise wrap that variable in a lazy pythonizer function.

Writers
  - javascript test:
        Define all nodes allowed in a javascript writer, and fail whenever a not supported node is entered.
